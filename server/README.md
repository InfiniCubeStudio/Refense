<h2>These are the decicated server files.</h2>

> [!TIP]
> Running a server dedicated yields better performance 99% of the time.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This runs the game scripts directly, effectively being a client. However, as it is headless, most files used for visuals are left out, and only scripts required for the processing of game logic remain.

> [!CAUTION]
> Unpredictable bugs could occur as this is not a seperate workflow.
